# PersProj06_SecurityStatisticalReturns

The main aim of this study is to provide statistical information on investment returns. In particular, when a time horizon is selected (for example 10 or 20 years), historical price data is used to provide statistical information (distribution, mean, median, max, min, etc.) on the expected returns. The approach used in this analysis differs from the typical return calculation. The main idea behind the approach introduced in the Jupiter Notebook, is that the investment starting day is random, and not at the beginning/end of each month, quarter or year as it is usually assumed in financial analysis.
